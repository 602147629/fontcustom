## Help make Font Custom better!

This project was born out of an overheard conversation between two devs in a
NYC coffee shop — it's come a long ways thanks to your support.

### Wishlist / Roadmap

* Ruby on Rails integration
* Compass integration
* Base 64 encode fonts into CSS
* Templates for LESS, stylus, etc.
* Ligature support
* Windows support
* Make better use of Thor

### Conventions

We try to follow the [Github ruby styleguide](https://github.com/styleguide/ruby) 
as much as possible. 

If you catch a typo or a block of code that could be more elegant — please let
us know. No such thing as too small of an improvement.

### Process

* Visit [issues](https://github.com/FontCustom/fontcustom/issues) for ideas.
* Fork the repo.
* Create a topic branch. `git checkout -b my_sweet_feature`
* Add your tests. Run tests with `rake`.
* Develop your feature.
* Once all tests are passing, submit a pull request!
