## TODO

* `clear_file` and `append_to_file` can probably be combined
* documentation for changing `project_root` in config

* Messages for improper config, default settings, etc.
* Colors for thor :say
* Handle error through Fontcustom::Actions

* Util should be broken up into actions and Options
* Options could be a class?
